## Why Learn Haskell? The Rise of Functional Programming

In recent years, there’s been a noticeable shift in the programming world. Modern Object-Oriented (OO) languages are increasingly borrowing concepts like first-class & higher-order functions, immutability, pure functions, and more from Functional Programming (FP). Why? Because FP has proven to be a better way to build reliable, maintainable, and scalable software. But here’s the catch: while OO languages like C# are trying to adapt FP concepts, they often fall short because their compilers and runtime environments weren’t designed with these paradigms in mind.

This isn’t just a theoretical shift—it’s happening at the highest levels of industry. Microsoft, for example, has hired Simon Peyton Jones, one of the creators of Haskell, to help guide their functional programming efforts. Tim Sweeney, the founder of Epic Games, is working with Simon on a new language called Verse, which brings FP concepts into game development. Meanwhile, companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink are using Haskell to solve some of the most complex and high-stakes problems in the world.

## Why not go with the status quo, Object-Oriented Programming?

While these languages are very popular, in practice they are a nightmare for large projects. Why? Imagine you have a huge bin of LEGOs. You decide to recruit 4 friends to helpyou with an ambitious project: building a robot! There are infinitely many ways to put together pieces of lego, as well as infinite ways this project can go right or wrong. While there are many outcomes we can definitely know the characteristics of a successful project vs an unsuccessful one.

### Unsuccessful Characteristics
1. The pieces may work properly on their own but not altogether
2. There may be a faulty component
3. Failures in connected components cause failures in other components
4. One or many components fail when facing some obstacle, such as a bump in the floor, that the robot cannot handle successfully.

### Successful Characteristics 

1. For any set of inputs in an environment it is designed for, the robot as a whole can successfully maneuver 
2. It can perform all the cool tricks you and your amigos designed it to do!
3. And hopefully, you also enjoyed the project and watching it in action

If you were to all take on a different component of the body independent of each other you would likely run into plenty of integration issues. For example, the legs may receive power in a different manner than the arms. There's also the balance and coordination of the robot: when it comes to a bump how does it know to position its arms given the movement of the legs. Are the legs and feet to scale to support the weight of the body? 

Fast forward a few weeks and your new challenge is how to write an adapter, instead of connecting the arms to the torso you connect the arm to the adapter which is connected to the torso. But you still are up against the same original challenges like how do you make sure it balances and now you have much more weight to consider. At this point you and the amigos are much less happy as some of you think "Maybe we should just start fresh" and others think "I am not throwing away 4 weeks of work! I will make an adapter for the adapter if I have to". 

How did we get here? 

You would have been successful if from the start you created pieces which were 100% perfect and did everything they need to and nothing more. 

That might sound difficult but this is the essence of beautiful engineering, math and design. Addition is built on counting which allows us to define multiplication. Similarly if we started with systems that can be fully defined in terms of all inputs and outputs, then we would know that this independent system would just be like another piece of LEGO that we can easily combine with other LEGOs and other well-built systems. 

Ace is a platform which is built entirely using functional programming with the Haskell language. It's allowed for automatic database migration without fear, in-depth video processing through WebRTC, and over 150 unique features. We can easily add new features without worry of breaking old ones. Even when we need to change old features, we can do so easily because of the type awareness of the Haskell compiler. 

Our team has also been in many projects written in object-oriented languages, which initially seemed quick with the use of libraries but then spent even longer working to adapt the library to some other component and spaghetti code that no one has been willing to touch for years. 

The difference in the outcomes these projects have in practice simply comes down to the compiler. As we will see throughout the Ace program, it comes down to the Haskell compiler disallowing numerous problematic ways to code, and the thinking patterns that result from working with such a strongly typed compiler.

After using Haskell, you will have a mental framework to discover the best solution to any given problem. You will also know the difference between strong and weak coding patterns and know whether or not you can trust a function. This mental framework is one that can be applied not only to amazing languages like Haskell and other functional strongly-typed languages but even to languages which don't stop you from writing bad code. 

## Why Does Functional Programming Matter?

Before we dive into Haskell, let’s talk about why FP is gaining so much traction. The core principles of FP—immutability, pure functions, laziness, and generative testing—offer solutions to many of the challenges that OO programming struggles with.

- **Immutability**: In FP, data is immutable by default. This means that once you create a value, it cannot be changed. Compare this to C#, where objects can often change state in unpredictable ways, leading to bugs that are hard to track down. In Haskell, because data doesn’t change, you can reason about your code more easily, leading to fewer bugs and more robust software.

- **Pure Functions**: A pure function is one that, given the same inputs, always produces the same output and has no side effects. This is a cornerstone of FP and contrasts sharply with the OO approach, where methods often modify the state of objects or interact with global state. In C#, methods often have side effects, which can make programs harder to understand and maintain. In Haskell, the use of pure functions means that your code is more predictable and easier to test.

- **Laziness**: Haskell is a lazy language, meaning that it doesn’t evaluate expressions until absolutely necessary. This can lead to performance improvements and allows for the creation of more abstract and reusable code. In contrast, C# is an eager language, evaluating expressions as soon as they are encountered, which can sometimes lead to inefficiencies.

- **Generative Testing**: FP languages often emphasize generative testing, where the program itself generates test cases. This is in contrast to traditional unit testing in OO languages like C#, where developers manually write test cases. Haskell’s QuickCheck library, for example, allows you to describe properties that your functions should satisfy, and then automatically generates test cases to verify those properties. This approach can uncover edge cases that you might never think to test manually.

## A Side-by-Side Comparison: C# (OOP) vs. Haskell (FP)

Let’s look at some specific examples to see how these differences play out in practice.

### Example 1: Immutability

In C#, immutability is not the default. Here’s how you might write a class that represents a point in 2D space:

```csharp
public class Point {
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public void Move(int deltaX, int deltaY) {
        X += deltaX;
        Y += deltaY;
    }
}
```

This class allows you to change the position of the point after it’s created. This mutable state can lead to bugs, especially in larger systems where the state might be modified by different parts of the program at different times.

Now, here’s how you might write a similar structure in Haskell:

```haskell
data Point = Point { x :: Int, y :: Int }

move :: Point -> Int -> Int -> Point
move (Point x y) deltaX deltaY = Point (x + deltaX) (y + deltaY)
```

In Haskell, Point is immutable. The move function doesn’t change the original point—it returns a new point with the updated coordinates. This immutability makes the code easier to reason about, as you never have to worry about the state of a Point changing unexpectedly.

### Example 2: Pure Functions

Consider a method in C# that reads a file and processes its contents:

```csharp
public string ProcessFile(string filePath) {
    string content = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
    return content.ToUpper();
}
```

This method is not pure. It has a side effect (reading a file from the disk) and its output depends on the state of the file system.

In Haskell, you would separate the side effect (reading the file) from the pure function (processing the contents):

```haskell
processFile :: String -> IO String
processFile filePath = do
    content <- readFile filePath
    return (map toUpper content)
```

Here, readFile is an IO action that performs the side effect of reading the file, but map toUpper is a pure function that transforms the string. This separation makes the code easier to test and reason about.

### Example 3: Laziness

In C#, if you create a list of numbers, the list is fully evaluated as soon as it’s created:

```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
```

If this list is large, it might consume a significant amount of memory, even if you only need to process a few elements.

In Haskell, lists are lazy by default:

```haskell
numbers = [1..]
```

This creates an infinite list of numbers, but it’s not evaluated until you actually need the elements. You can then take just the first few elements without evaluating the entire list:

```haskell
take 5 numbers  -- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This laziness allows you to work with potentially infinite data structures in a way that’s both memory-efficient and conceptually elegant.

## The Bottom Line: Why You Should Learn Haskell

The industry is moving towards functional programming for good reason. As software systems become more complex, and as AI developers become more prevalent, the advantages of FP (immutability, pure functions, laziness, and generative testing) are becoming increasingly clear. While OO languages like C# are trying to incorporate these concepts, they often do so in a way that feels bolted-on rather than native. Haskell, on the other hand, was designed from the ground up with these principles in mind.

By learning Haskell, you’re not just learning a new language. You’re adopting a new way of thinking about programming. This shift in mindset will make you a better developer, no matter what language you ultimately use. Whether you’re working on high-stakes projects at a company like Tesla, developing the next big game at Epic, or simply trying to write better, more reliable code, the skills you gain from learning Haskell will serve you well.

So let’s dive in and start learning Haskell. You’re about to unlock a powerful new approach to programming that will change the way you think about code forever.
