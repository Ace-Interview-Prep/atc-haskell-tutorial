# ATC Haskell Tutorial

## Welcome to the Ace Talent Community!

We are excited to be a part of your journey through learning a new development paradigm that will truly set you apart from your competition in this ever-growing industry of software engineering. This guide is designed to help you master **functional programming** in Haskell, a language and paradigm that not only changes how you think about solving problems but also helps you write safer, more scalable, and maintainable code.

In this repository, you’ll find a structured learning path, walking you through the core principles of Haskell, from types and immutability to advanced topics like property-based testing and Nix for deterministic environments. By the end of this journey, you'll have a deep understanding of how to model real-world problems using Haskell’s powerful type system and functional programming constructs.

### Table of Contents

Below are the chapters that will guide you through this journey:

0. [**Chapter 0 - Think Like a Functional Programmer**](./chapter0.md)  
   Learn how to approach problem-solving by thinking like a functional programmer, breaking down problems using first principles, and understanding the core mindset behind functional programming.

1. [**Chapter 1 - Types & Domain Theory**](./chapter1.md)  
   Learn how types in Haskell are more than just simple categories for data—they can help you model complex business domains in ways that are safe and easy to reason about.

2. [**Chapter 2 - Immutability Changes Everything**](./chapter2.md)  
   Understand why immutability is at the heart of functional programming, how it simplifies your code, and how it makes testing, concurrency, and reasoning about programs easier.

3. [**Chapter 3 - It’s All Patterns**](./chapter3.md)  
   Dive deep into pattern matching, one of Haskell’s most powerful features, to destructure and manipulate data in clear and concise ways.

4. [**Chapter 4 - Working with Lists and Sets**](./chapter4.md)  
   Explore how to work with Haskell’s core data structures—lists and sets—and discover how functional programming offers elegant ways to manipulate collections of data.

5. [**Chapter 5 - String Parsing**](./chapter5.md)  
   Learn how to handle string data effectively in Haskell, from basic string manipulation to building powerful parsers using libraries like Parsec.

6. [**Chapter 6 - Combine Your Functions**](./chapter6.md)  
   Master function composition, one of the core principles of Haskell, to build complex logic by combining simple, pure functions.

7. [**Chapter 7 - (Witty Title for Recursion)**](./chapter7.md)  
   Recursion is fundamental in Haskell. Learn how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-referential pieces, unlocking the power of recursion.

8. [**Chapter 8 - Building Something Real**](./chapter8.md)  
   Get hands-on and start building a real-world Haskell application, applying the skills you’ve learned so far.

9. [**Chapter 9 - Generative Property Testing**](./chapter9.md)  
   Learn about property-based testing and how to use tools like QuickCheck to automatically generate test cases that validate the core properties of your functions.

10. [**Chapter 10 - Building Your First API**](./chapter10.md)  
    Learn how to create a robust API in Haskell, using modern frameworks to build scalable web services.

11. [**Chapter 11 - Databases and FRMs**](./chapter11.md)  
    Understand how to interact with databases in a functional programming context, using frameworks like Persistent to enforce type safety.

12. [**Chapter 12 - Cross-Platform Web/Mobile Development**](./chapter12.md)  
    Discover how Haskell can be used for cross-platform development, leveraging frameworks like Reflex and Obelisk for web and mobile apps.

13. [**Chapter 13 - Deterministic Environments Using Nix**](./chapter13.md)  
    Find out how Nix can help you create deterministic and reproducible development environments, ensuring that your Haskell code runs the same way across all systems.

### How to Use This Guide

Each chapter contains a detailed explanation of core Haskell concepts, code examples, and exercises to solidify your understanding. We recommend starting with **Chapter 0** and progressing through each chapter in sequence, as each concept builds upon the previous one. Take your time to explore each section and practice the exercises to get the most out of this guide.

Feel free to open issues or contribute if you find improvements or want to add your own knowledge to the guide. The Ace Talent Community is all about helping each other grow and master new skills, so don’t hesitate to engage with the community!

We’re excited to see what you build!
